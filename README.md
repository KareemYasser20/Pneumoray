# Pneumoray
The Pneumory app used to detect bacterial and viral pneumonia through digital x-ray images using convolutional neural network and pre-trained convolutional neural network such as VGG16 and ResNet50. The experiment using public chest x-ray images from Kaggle. The proposed study can be useful in more quickly diagnosing pneumonia by the radiologist.

The App Demo:
